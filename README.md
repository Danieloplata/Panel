## About

As a learning exercise I am simultaneously creating a new project in both [vanilla PHP](https://php.net) and [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). I am creating this in a public repository as I am interested in submitting the project for code review when it nears completion.

## The system

The task is to create a piece of project management software, mainly centred around online questionnaires/surveys. The main feature of this will be a Panel, which will serve as a seperation layer between the surveys and the wider web, allowing for greater control, greater targeting and security.

Some potential benefits of this might be

- Duplicate checks
- Automatically blocking repeat attempts
- Limiting survey to specific countries on a 'per project' basis
- Limiting survey to specific devices, or operating systems
- Monitoring the progress of a survey without direct access to the data

If possible, I would also like to create built-in screeners - with the possibility of allowing conditional bypasses of checks or advanced survey routing.
